/**
 * this is the primary activity for Rummikub Application
 *
 * - Enhancements
 * The joker tile would display the value and color of its assigned value in the
 * tile set on the table.  This value would only show up if the group containing the joker is
 * confirmed a valid set or book.  This is usually whenever the player ends their turn by pressing
 * knock or draw.  The joker values would diaper whenever the joker isn't part of a
 * proper set of run
 *
 * Known Bugs/Issues before Beta Testing
 * - Joker Value would disappear - If a human player were to try and split a group of tiles on the
 * table witch contained a joker the joker value would disappear when deselecting the tiles.
 * This was a issue that was found during our Beta Testing in class.
 * We discovered this bug before our testing session but discovered that the code to fix this issue
 * wasn't added to the version before class.  This was due to either a merge error or human error.
 * The Joker value was getting reset in the State before we would remove it form the current group.
 * In the case of the joker, the group can't be split due to the Freeing the Joker Rule.
 * Since the State thought that we would split the group it reset the joker tile prematurely.
 * While people were testing for failure the encountered this error.  We believe that this bug may
 * have been the cause to some of the network play bugs involving the joker tile not updating for
 * everyone.  Since the Beta Testing we have addressed this issue and are testing it further to see
 * if this indeed fixed the bug.
 * - Joker Value would be wrong for books, - This was the same issue as above and was fixed.  The
 * joker color value was being assigned before the other tiles in the group were checked.  This was
 * fixed by assigning the joker values after the other tiles in the book are checked.  Then the
 * joker color is set to one of the remaining unused colors in the book.
 * - AI would get stuck - While testing our game before class we didn't encounter the issue of the
 * the AI getting stuck during their turn.  We believe that we know the cause of the issue.  This
 * only happened when the smart AI would decide on what move to make.  This might have been
 * caused by an issue involving checking if a group containing a joker is valid.  In that case, the
 * joker bugs above may have played a factor into this as well.
